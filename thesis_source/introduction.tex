\section{Motivation}
\label{section:motivation}
In production line, the quality check process is the final and the most important step before the products roll out. 
Having automatic inspection platform on the production line could speed up the production speed and reduce the chance that product with defect getting on the shelf. Witch is important for all manufacturers.
Since the previous solution is obsoleted. It doesn't performs well on lettering defect detection and couldn't identify the color of LED back-light of the keyboard.
In this thesis, we will introduce the construction and implementation of an AOI(Automatic Optics Inspection) system that is special designed to do the LED self illuminated keyboards. 


\section{Goal}
\label{section:goal}
Design an AOI(Automatic Optics Inspection) system is have ability to detect the \emph{lettering defect} and \emph{LED multifunction} from \emph{given image} or from \emph{camera}.
Need to be \emph{accurate}, \emph{scalable} and both \emph{time \& cost effective} in order to meet the requirement of production line.
