Chapter 3 Methods
	
	Learning Stage
		Load Reference Images from Camera or File
		Capturing Feature Points or Ohter Infomations From the Image
		Store Those Infomation For Examining Stage

	Examining Stage
		Load Sample Images from Camera
		Capturing Feature Points or Ohter Infomations From the Image
		Matching Feature Points with Reference Image to find Homography Matrix
		Apply Defect Detection Methods

Chapter 4 Comparision Between Other Methods

	Different Feature Point Extration Methods
		SIFT
		SURF
		BRISK
		ORB
		FREAK

	Comparithen between each methods
		Create a chart or cost table for each feature extraction methods, 
		leave some comment on the methods. (pros & cons ...)
